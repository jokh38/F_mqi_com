# Development Progress Report

This document tracks the logical tracing of the MQI Communicator application, identifies issues, and details the fixes applied.

## Initial Analysis and Planning

*   **Codebase Exploration**: Reviewed `main.py`, `db_manager.py`, `case_scanner.py`, `workflow_submitter.py`, `config.yaml`, and `instruction.md`.
*   **Logical Flow**: Traced the lifecycle of a case from detection to completion.
*   **Key Findings**: Identified a critical bug in the recovery logic for 'submitting' cases, as well as several code quality and configuration issues.
*   **Initial Plan**: Developed a multi-step plan focusing on configuration fixes, testing, and bug resolution.

## Problem 1: Flake8 Configuration Conflict

*   **Issue**: The `.flake8` configuration file specified `max-line-length = 88` but also included `E501` (line too long) in its ignore list, making the length check ineffective.
*   **Fix**: Removed `E501` from the `extend-ignore` list to enforce the 88-character line limit.

## Problem 2: Missing Test Package Initializers

*   **Issue**: The `tests/common` and `tests/services` directories were missing `__init__.py` files, which can lead to issues with test discovery in some environments.
*   **Fix**: Added empty `__init__.py` files to both directories to ensure they are treated as proper Python packages.

## Problem 3: Critical Bug in 'Submitting' Case Recovery

*   **Issue**: A logical bug was found in the recovery logic for cases with the status `submitting`. If the application found a matching remote task, it would correctly update the case status to `running`. However, due to an indentation error, it would then immediately proceed to mark the same case as `failed` and release its GPU resource. This would prevent any stuck case from ever being recovered successfully.
*   **TDD Process**:
    1.  A new test, `test_main_loop_recovers_stuck_submitting_case_correctly`, was added to `tests/test_main.py`.
    2.  This test specifically set up the "stuck submitting" scenario and asserted that `update_case_completion` was NOT called.
    3.  Running `pytest` confirmed the bug, with the new test failing as expected.
*   **Fix**: The incorrect indentation in `src/main.py` was corrected. The two lines that marked the case as failed were moved inside the `else` block where they were intended to be, ensuring they only execute when a remote task ID cannot be found.
*   **Verification**: The test suite was run again, and all 41 tests passed, confirming the bug was resolved and no regressions were introduced. This also improved the test coverage of `src/main.py` from 64% to 70%.
