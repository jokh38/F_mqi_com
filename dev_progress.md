# Development Progress Report - Cycle 2

## Part 1: Logical Code Flow Analysis (Case Detection)

After resolving the submission race condition, the next logical area to inspect is the initial detection of new cases. The flow is as follows:

1.  **Watch Service**: The `CaseScanner` service uses the `watchdog` library to monitor the `new_cases/` directory for any file system events.
2.  **Event Trigger**: When a new directory, e.g., `case_xyz`, is created inside `new_cases/`, `watchdog` is intended to fire an event.
3.  **Immediate DB Insertion**: The event handler is designed to immediately take the path of the new directory and call `db_manager.add_case()`, which inserts it into the database with the status `submitted`.
4.  **Main Loop Pickup**: The main application loop, which polls the database every few seconds, quickly picks up this new `submitted` case for processing.

## Part 2: Predicted Problem: The "Incomplete Case" Race Condition

A significant race condition exists in the case detection logic. The `CaseScanner` is too "eager" and acts on incomplete information.

**Problem Trace:**

1.  A user or an automated process begins copying a large case directory (containing multiple files and subdirectories) into the `new_cases/` directory.
2.  The top-level directory (e.g., `new_cases/case_xyz`) is created on the filesystem almost instantly, while its contents are still being copied.
3.  The `watchdog` observer in `CaseScanner` detects the creation of this new directory and immediately triggers its event handler.
4.  The handler adds the `case_xyz` path to the database as a `submitted` case.
5.  Within seconds, the main loop picks up `case_xyz` for processing and initiates an `scp` transfer to the remote HPC.
6.  **The `scp` command reads the `case_xyz` directory while files are still being written to it.** This results in an incomplete or corrupted copy of the case being sent to the HPC.
7.  The remote job inevitably fails due to missing or incomplete files, wasting HPC resources and leading to incorrect failure reports.

## Part 3: Implemented Solution: Configurable Quiescence Period

The existing code already contained a basic "quiescence" mechanism to address this, but it used a hardcoded delay value and was not properly integrated with the application's configuration. The solution was to refactor this implementation to make it robust and configurable.

### 1. Made Quiescence Configurable

*   **`config/config.yaml`**: A new parameter, `quiescence_period_seconds`, was added under the `scanner` section, with a descriptive comment. This allows administrators to tune the delay based on network speed and typical case size.
*   **`src/services/case_scanner.py`**: The hardcoded `STABILITY_DELAY_SECONDS` constant was removed. The `CaseScanner` class was modified to accept the application's `config` dictionary in its constructor. It now reads the `quiescence_period_seconds` from the config and passes it to the `StableDirectoryEventHandler`.
*   **`src/main.py`**: The instantiation of `CaseScanner` was updated to pass the loaded `config` object, properly wiring the new configuration into the scanner service.

This refactoring makes the file-watching logic more robust and adaptable. By waiting for a configurable period of inactivity before processing a new directory, the application can be confident that the directory copy is complete, thus preventing the "incomplete case" problem.
