# Developer 2 - Development Log

This log documents the work done by Developer 2 on the MQI Communicator project.

## Task: Implement `services/case_scanner.py`

My primary responsibility was to implement the module responsible for detecting new cases using `watchdog`.

## Development Process

I followed the Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow as outlined in the development guide.

1.  **Update Development Guide**: My first task was to update `docs/development_guide.md` to include instructions on how to install the necessary static analysis tools. This was a direct request from the user.
2.  **Test-First Approach**: I created a failing test in `tests/services/test_case_scanner.py` before writing the implementation. This helped define the requirements for the `case_scanner` module.
3.  **Implementation**: I then wrote the code in `src/services/case_scanner.py` to make the test pass.
4.  **Refactoring and Integration Testing**: I added the `CaseScanner` class to manage the `watchdog` observer and added an integration test to ensure all parts worked together.
5.  **Static Analysis**: Finally, I ran `black`, `flake8`, and `mypy` to ensure code quality.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Initial `ImportError`

*   **Problem**: The initial tests failed with an `ImportError` because the `pytest` command couldn't find the `src` module.
*   **Solution**: The `development_guide.md` correctly stated that tests must be run with `python -m pytest`. Adhering to the guide solved this.

### Challenge: Missing Dependencies

*   **Problem**: The test runner failed because `pytest` and other dependencies were not installed in the environment.
*   **Solution**: I installed all required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`. I had forgotten this basic setup step. This highlighted the importance of my first task, which was to document the installation of these tools.

### Challenge: Incorrect Class Name (`DBManager` vs. `DatabaseManager`)

*   **Problem**: My code failed with an `ImportError` because I assumed the database manager class was named `DBManager`, but Developer 1 had named it `DatabaseManager`.
*   **Solution**: I used `read_file` to inspect `src/common/db_manager.py` and corrected the class name in my code. This was a good reminder to always verify interfaces with team members' code instead of making assumptions.

### Challenge: `flake8` Linting Errors

*   **Problem**: After writing the code, `flake8` reported several errors related to import order (`E402`) and unused imports (`F401`).
*   **Solution**: I refactored the code to move all imports to the top of the file and removed any that were unused or redefined. This improved code cleanliness. I had to use `read_file` and `overwrite_file_with_block` carefully to fix this after `black` reformatted the code, which initially caused my `replace_with_git_merge_diff` to fail.
