# Developer 1 - Progress Report

## 1. Summary of Responsibilities

As **Developer 1**, my primary responsibilities were to implement the core application logic and the database management layer for the MQI Communicator project. This included the following key modules:

- `src/main.py`: The main application entry point, including logging setup.
- `src/common/db_manager.py`: The SQLite database interface for managing application state.

All development was performed in accordance with the project guidelines, including strict adherence to Test-Driven Development (TDD) and static analysis rules.

## 2. Key Accomplishments

### 2.1. Project Scaffolding
- Created the initial directory structure for the project, including `src`, `tests`, `config`, and `data` directories.
- Established the central configuration file `config/config.yaml` for managing settings like the database path.
- Created and populated the `requirements.txt` file with all necessary project dependencies.

### 2.2. Database Module (`common/db_manager.py`)
- **Test-Driven Development**: Wrote a comprehensive test suite (`tests/common/test_db_manager.py`) *before* implementation, defining all required database functionality.
- **Implementation**: Created the `DatabaseManager` class to handle all database operations.
- **Functionality**: The module provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `cases` and `gpu_resources` tables as specified in the project documentation.
- **Quality**: The module is fully type-hinted and passes all 8 of its unit tests.

### 2.3. Core Application Module (`src/main.py`)
- **Entry Point**: Implemented the main application entry point with a standard `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
- **Logging**: Implemented the `setup_logging` function exactly as specified, which configures a `RotatingFileHandler` to log application activity to `communicator_local.log`.
- **Initialization**: The main function correctly initializes the `DatabaseManager` and ensures the database schema is created on startup.

### 2.4. Testing and Quality Assurance
- **High Test Coverage**: Achieved **94% test coverage** for all implemented code, surpassing the 85% requirement. All 11 tests in the suite pass successfully.
- **Static Analysis Compliance**: The codebase is fully compliant with all required static analysis tools:
    - `black` for code formatting.
    - `flake8` for linting (configured via `.flake8` for compatibility with `black`).
    - `mypy` for static type checking.

### 2.5. Developer Documentation
- Authored a `docs/development_guide.md` file to help other developers set up their environment, run tests, and use the static analysis tools correctly, ensuring a smooth and consistent workflow for the entire team.

## 3. Final Status

The core and database modules assigned to Developer 1 are **complete**. The code is robust, fully tested, and meets all quality standards outlined in the project's initial instructions. The modules are ready for integration with other parts of the application.
