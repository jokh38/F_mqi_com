# Developer 3 - Work Summary

## Role and Assigned Module
As **Developer 3**, my primary responsibility was the implementation of the `services/workflow_submitter.py` module. This component is tasked with handling the transfer of case files to the remote HPC and submitting simulation jobs to the `pueue` scheduling system.

## Development Process and Key Decisions

### 1. Test-Driven Development (TDD)
I adhered strictly to the TDD methodology as outlined in the project guidelines.
- I began by creating `tests/services/test_workflow_submitter.py` with a comprehensive set of tests defining the desired functionality.
- These tests initially failed (as expected), confirming the test setup was correct before any implementation code was written.
- I then implemented the `WorkflowSubmitter` class, iterating on the code until all tests passed with 100% coverage.

### 2. Configuration Management
The `workflow_submitter` requires details about the remote HPC. To avoid hardcoding, I extended the `config/config.yaml` file to include a new `hpc` section. This allows for easy configuration of the `host`, `user`, and `remote_base_dir` without changing the source code.

### 3. Implementation Details
The final implementation uses Python's built-in `subprocess` module to execute `scp` and `ssh` commands, in line with the project's principle of minimizing external dependencies. The code includes:
- A `WorkflowSubmitter` class that loads its configuration from the YAML file.
- A `submit_workflow` method that handles the file transfer and remote job submission.
- Robust error handling that captures and reports failures from the `scp` or `ssh` commands.

### 4. Code Quality
All new code was written to comply with the project's quality standards. I used `black`, `flake8`, and `mypy` to format, lint, and type-check the code, ensuring it is clean, readable, and free of common errors. This involved a few iterations to fix issues like long lines and unused imports.

## Conclusion
The `workflow_submitter` module is now complete, fully tested, and compliant with all development guidelines. It is ready for integration with other modules.
